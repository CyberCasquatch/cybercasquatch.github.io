Description
-----------

Following the release of SpectreOps' research paper [Certified Pre-Owned](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf), Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) quickly became a favoured attack vector for malicious actors. The primary reasons include:

*   Certificates provide advantages over traditional username/password authentication.
*   Many PKI servers are misconfigured or vulnerable to known attack techniques.

Gaining control over the Certificate Authority (CA) presents several risks:

*   Certificates can remain valid for over a year.
*   Changing a password does not revoke an issued certificate.
*   Poorly configured templates can allow attackers to obtain certificates as any user.
*   Compromising the CAâ€™s private key enables attackers to forge Golden Certificates.

These factors make certificates a prime target for persistent attacks. While SpectreOps identified eight privilege escalation techniques, we will focus on the first, ESC1:

> Domain escalation via No Issuance Requirements + Enrollable Client Authentication/Smart Card Logon OID templates + CT\_FLAG\_ENROLLEE\_SUPPLIES\_SUBJECT.

Attack
------

To identify vulnerabilities in the PKI infrastructure, we use Certify to scan the environment. The output highlights vulnerable certificate templates. In our example, the CA is `PKI.eagle.local\eagle-PKI-CA`, and the vulnerable template is `UserCert`. Key issues include:

*   All domain users can request a certificate using this template.
*   The `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT` flag is enabled, allowing requesters to specify the Subject Alternative Name (SAN), meaning they can obtain certificates as any user.
*   Manager approval is not required; certificates are issued immediately.
*   The certificate is valid for client authentication.

To exploit this, we use Certify with the following parameters:

    Certify.exe request /ca:PKI.eagle.local\eagle-PKI-CA /template:UserCert /subject:Administrator

After execution, the command returns a PEM certificate in Base64 format. Before converting it to PFX, ensure proper formatting with:

Then, convert it using OpenSSL:

With the PFX certificate in hand, we use Rubeus to request a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the Administrator account, allowing authentication and access to the C$ share on DC1.

Prevention
----------

Mitigating this attack involves:

*   Disabling `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT` in certificate templates.
*   Requiring CA certificate manager approval before issuance.
*   Regularly scanning the PKI environment with [Certify](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) or similar tools.

Detection
---------

When a CA issues a certificate, two key events are logged:

*   Event ID **4886**: Certificate request received.
*   Event ID **4887**: Certificate issued.

These events appear on the CA rather than the Domain Controller. They provide some insight but do not specify if the SAN was manipulated. To examine issued certificates, administrators can check the CA's list of issued certificates.

To view details:

    certutil -view

If the attacker uses the certificate for authentication, Active Directory logs Event ID **4768**, which records Kerberos TGT requests. Searching for these can help detect misuse.

To monitor logs programmatically, use PowerShell:

    Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" -FilterXPath "*[System/EventID=4886]"

To format the output:

    Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" -FilterXPath "*[System/EventID=4886]" | Format-List

### QUESTIONS

#### Connect to the Kali host first, then RDP to WS001 as 'bob:Slavi123' and practice the techniques shown in this section. What is the flag value located at \\dc1\c$\scripts?
ANSWER:

#### After performing the ESC1 attack, connect to PKI (172.16.18.15) as 'htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!' and look at the logs. On what date was the very first certificate requested and issued?
