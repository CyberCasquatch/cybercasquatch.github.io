> In this blog, I walk through the lab step-by-step and include screenshots to document my process and learning.

This week I tackled **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)** using [Rene Molenaar’s GNS3 Vault lab](https://gns3vault.com/switching/vtp-vlan-trunking-protocol). VTP helps reduce the administrative overhead of managing VLANs across multiple switches—perfect for anyone studying for their CCNA or just diving deeper into Layer 2 networking.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Create VLANs on Bobcat

**Instruction:**

> Create the following VLANs on switch Bobcat:  
> VLAN 10: name Tigers  
> VLAN 20: name Lions  
> VLAN 30: name Panthers

All VLANs created successfully!

## 🔌 Step 2: Configure Trunk Ports

**Instruction:**

> Configure the interfaces between the switches as trunks:  
> Gi0/0 on Bobcat, Gi0/0 and Gi0/1 on Tiger, and Gi0/0 on Panther.

Commands used:

```
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30
```

✅ Trunking interfaces configured and active.

💾 Don't forget to save:
```
copy run start
```

## 🧠 Step 3: Configure Bobcat as VTP Server

Set the VTP domain, version, password, and mode:

```
vtp domain GNS3Vault
vtp mode server
vtp version 2
vtp password Vault
```

📌 This makes Bobcat the central VLAN manager.

## 🖥️ Step 4: Configure Panther as VTP Client

Now Panther can receive VLAN updates from the server.

```
vtp domain GNS3Vault
vtp mode client
vtp version 2
vtp password Vault
```

🛰️ Synced and ready to go.

## 🧙 Step 5: Configure Tiger as VTP Transparent

Tiger won’t sync to the latest VLAN info but will forward VTP advertisements. Useful when a switch needs to bridge VTP info between other switches but not be part of the sync.

```
vtp domain GNS3Vault
vtp mode transparent
vtp version 2
vtp password Vault
```

### Trunk Interface Configs:

```
interface gi0/0
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan all

interface gi0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan all
```

## 🚫 Step 6: Reduce Unnecessary VLAN Traffic (VTP Pruning)

**Instruction:**

> Enable VTP pruning to prevent broadcast/multicast traffic from going where it's not needed.

On Bobcat (the VTP server):

```
vtp pruning
```

This helps improve network performance by preventing VLAN traffic from being flooded unnecessarily across trunk links.

## 🧾 Final Thoughts

This was a great exercise in:

- Practicing VLAN creation and trunk configuration
- Understanding VTP server/client/transparent roles
- Learning how VTP pruning optimizes trunk link usage

Working through this lab gave me a clearer picture of how VLANs are managed in networks. Huge thanks to [Rene Molenaar](https://gns3vault.com) for the awesome lab!

Up next? Maybe Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) or some STP madness.
