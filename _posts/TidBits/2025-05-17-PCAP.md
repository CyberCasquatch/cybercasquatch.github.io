> What is PCAP (Packet Capture)?

PCAP files are data files created using a program. These files contain packet data of a network and
are used to analyze the network characteristics. They also contribute to controlling the network
traffic and determining network status. Using PCAP files, teams can attend to detect network
problems and resolve data communications using various programs. Security teams can use a
network packet capture tool to identify, analyze, inspect, and monitor network traffic. Unusual
traffic spikes can be due to a faulty application or a security breach. The packet capture tool allows
IT teams to identify the root cause of the issues by tracking network packets.
