# üîí Blocking Ping in the Same VLAN Using VACLs on a Cisco Switch

Have you ever needed to block **ping (ICMP)** traffic between two devices on the **same VLAN**, while still allowing other types of communication? Traditional router-based ACLs won‚Äôt help in this case, because **Layer 2 switches forward traffic within the same VLAN without routing it**.

That‚Äôs where **VACLs (VLAN Access Control Lists)** come in.

---

## üß± What Are VACLs?

VACLs apply access control policies **within a VLAN**, regardless of whether traffic is being bridged (switched) or routed. Unlike **port-based ACLs (PACLs)**, which only apply to ingress traffic on a switchport, **VACLs apply to all traffic within the specified VLAN(s)**.

This is especially useful for enforcing **security policies between same-subnet hosts** on a switch.

---

## üßæ Lab Scenario

You have a topology like this:

- **SW1** (Layer 2 switch)
- **DNS1** connected to `gi0/0`, IP: `192.168.10.1`
- **DNS2** connected to `gi0/1`, IP: `192.168.10.2`
- Both hosts are in **VLAN 10**

üéØ **Goal**: Prevent DNS1 and DNS2 from pinging each other (block ICMP), but allow all other traffic.

## üîß Step 1: Assign Ports to VLAN 10

Configure both switchports as access ports in VLAN 10.

```
conf t
interface gi0/0
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
!
interface gi0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
```

## üîß Step 2: Create an Extended ACL

We‚Äôll use an extended ACL to match ICMP traffic between the two hosts.

```
ip access-list extended BLOCK_ICMP
 deny icmp host 192.168.10.1 host 192.168.10.2
 deny icmp host 192.168.10.2 host 192.168.10.1
 permit ip any any
```

---

## üîß Step 3: Create a VLAN Access Map

Bind the ACL to an action using a VLAN access map.

```
vlan access-map FILTER_VLAN10 10
 match ip address BLOCK_ICMP
 action drop
!
vlan access-map FILTER_VLAN10 20
 action forward
```

---

## üîß Step 4: Apply the Access Map to VLAN 10

```
vlan filter FILTER_VLAN10 vlan-list 10
```

---

## üîç Verification Commands

Check your configuration using the following commands:

```
show vlan access-map
show vlan filter
show access-lists BLOCK_ICMP
```

## üß™ Testing

1. From DNS1:
   ```
   ping 192.168.10.2
   ```

   ‚û°Ô∏è Should fail

2. Test other traffic (e.g., `telnet`, `ssh`) to confirm it still works. (I did not have the patience to configure telnet to make sure it worked so I stopped at making sure that the pings failed in this lab.)

---

## ‚úÖ Result

- DNS1 and DNS2 **cannot ping** each other.
- **All other communication is allowed**.
- Filtering is enforced at Layer 2 using **VLAN ACLs**.

Happy switching! üß†üîß
