I have suspended my subscription to TryHackMe for a little while so I can experience other platforms. 
Today I tried out CyberDefenders. the Webstrike lab which is currently (at the time of writing) not retired. 
This room was fun. I enjoy the investigative aspects of this work, though I need more practice with wireshark. 
(don't forget you can use http.user_agent) To find.....user agents.....
