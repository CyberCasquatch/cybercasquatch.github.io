> Network Simulation

This week I dove into GNS3 and built my very first network topology. As someone still learning the ropes of networking and CLI configurations, I figured the best way to get comfortable was to build something, break it, and learn from the mess. Mission accomplished. ðŸ˜…

## Building the Topology

I started with a basic setup using unmanaged switches from the GNS3 device library. These are simple to use but lack a console interface. Instead, configuration is done via the device's configuration panelâ€”just selecting VLANs and assigning the number of ports.

To get hands-on with Cisco CLI, I imported a Cisco Etherswitch and a router. These gave me the chance to practice actual device configurations through the terminal.

## CLI Highlights and Gotchas

Once inside `conf t` mode on the switch/router, I learned a few important commands:

- Enable **IP routing** on the switch:  
```
ip routing
```
- Convert a switch port to a routed port:  
```
  interface fa0/0  
  no switchport
```
- Don't forget to bring the interface up:  
```
  no shutdown
```

Tip: Routed ports usually use 0/x, while switching interfaces are 1/x. Routed ports need to be brought up, meaning you need to use the 'no shutdown' on all routed ports.

After configuring static routes between devices, I made sure everything could ping everything else. Always satisfying to see those replies.

## Duplex Drama
One lesson came from a duplex mismatch between FastEthernet (100Mbps) and GigabitEthernet (1Gbps) interfaces. This caused a bunch of annoying console messages:

To fix it:

- Disable auto-negotiation:  
```
  no negotiation auto
```
- Set duplex mode manually:  
```
  duplex auto
```
- Stop the message spam:  
```
  no logging console
```

NOTES:
GNS3 is powerful, but it helps to know your device limitations (especially unmanaged switches).
Interface types matterâ€”donâ€™t mix FastEthernet and Gigabit without adjusting duplex settings.
no logging console is your best friend when the device wonâ€™t shut up.
