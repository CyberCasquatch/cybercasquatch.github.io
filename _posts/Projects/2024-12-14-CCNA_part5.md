5.3 Configure and Verify Device Access Control Using Local Passwords
====================================================================

Overview of Device Access Control
---------------------------------

-   Ensures only authorized users can interact with a network device.
-   Local passwords are basic access controls configured directly on devices.
-   Passwords are stored locally and lack centralized management (e.g., RADIUS or TACACS+).

Access Points for Local Password Control
----------------------------------------

-   **Console Access:** Direct physical connection via the console port.
-   **VTY (Virtual Terminal) Lines:** Remote access through Telnet or SSH.
-   **Auxiliary Port:** Rarely used, typically for modem connections.

Configuring Local Passwords
---------------------------

### Steps for Configuration:

1.  **Console Access:**
    
    line console 0
    password login
                
    
2.  **VTY Lines:**
    
    line vty 0 4
    password login
                
    
3.  **Enable Secret Password:**
    
    enable secret 
    

Password Verification
---------------------

1.  **Console Login:** Connect physically and verify the password prompt.
2.  **VTY Access:** Use SSH or Telnet:
    
    ssh @
                
    
    Verify the correct password prompt.
3.  **Privilege Mode Password:** Enter privileged EXEC mode with `enable` and confirm the enable secret/password prompt.

Encrypting Local Passwords
--------------------------

By default, passwords are stored in plaintext. To encrypt them, use:

service password-encryption
    

This enables Type 7 encryption (weak, but better than plaintext).

Best Practices for Local Passwords
----------------------------------

-   Use strong passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
-   Always use `enable secret` over `enable password` for stronger encryption.
-   Enable `service password-encryption` to obscure plaintext passwords.
-   Restrict VTY access using ACLs (Access Control Lists).
-   Prefer local user accounts for more granular control:
    
    username secret 
                
    

Common Issues and Troubleshooting
---------------------------------

-   **Cannot Access Console/VTY:** Ensure the `login` command is included in the line configuration.
-   **No Enable Password:** Ensure `enable secret` or `enable password` is configured.
-   **Passwords Stored in Plaintext:** Enable `service password-encryption` to obscure passwords.

Key Takeaways
-------------

-   Local passwords provide basic access control and are stored directly on the device.
-   Always secure all access points (console, VTY, and auxiliary).
-   Use `enable secret` for privileged EXEC mode for strong encryption.
-   Encrypt passwords with `service password-encryption` to prevent plaintext storage.

---

5.4 Security Password Policies
==============================

1\. Password Management
-----------------------

Password management ensures secure handling of passwords throughout their lifecycle, reducing the risk of compromise.

### Key Elements:

-   **Password Aging:** Enforce periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days).
-   **Account Lockout:** Lock accounts after a set number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts, 15 minutes lockout).
-   **Password History:** Prevent reuse of recently used passwords (e.g., require 10 unique passwords).
-   **Secure Storage:** Store passwords in encrypted formats (e.g., hashed and salted).
-   **Self-Service Reset:** Allow secure password resets (e.g., verified email or MFA).

### Implementation in Networking Devices:

username <username> secret <password>
    

2\. Password Complexity
-----------------------

Complexity rules make passwords harder to guess, protecting against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

### Best Practices for Password Complexity:

-   **Length:** Require 8-12 characters (or longer).
-   **Character Types:** Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
-   **Avoid Predictable Patterns:** Avoid common words, phrases, or patterns (e.g., "password123").
-   **Passphrases:** Use phrases instead of single words (e.g., `H0wD0_Y0uKn0w?`).

### Implementation in Networking Devices:

Configure device login policies to enforce complexity (where supported).

3\. Password Alternatives
-------------------------

Password alternatives enhance security by supplementing or replacing traditional passwords.

### 3.a Multifactor Authentication (MFA):

-   **Definition:** Requires two or more independent factors to verify identity:
    -   Something You Know: Password or PIN.
    -   Something You Have: Security token, smart card, or mobile app.
    -   Something You Are: Biometric data (e.g., fingerprint).
-   **Advantages:** Reduces unauthorized access risk if one factor is compromised.
-   **Examples:** Use MFA providers (e.g., Duo, Cisco ISE) for device or VPN access.

### 3.b Certificates:

-   **Definition:** Cryptographic keys authenticate users or devices without passwords.
-   **How They Work:**
    -   Certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    -   Devices verify certificates during login or secure communications (e.g., HTTPS, 802.1X).
-   **Advantages:** Eliminates passwords; offers secure, scalable authentication.
-   **Examples in Networking:**
    
    ssh key generate rsa
                
    

### 3.c Biometrics:

-   **Definition:** Authentication based on unique biological characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition).
-   **Advantages:** Difficult to replicate or steal; no passwords to remember.
-   **Challenges:** Privacy concerns; reliance on specialized hardware.
-   **Examples in Networking:** Typically used for user authentication on management devices.

4\. Combining Passwords with Alternatives
-----------------------------------------

A hybrid approach increases security:

-   Use passwords with MFA for remote network access.
-   Deploy certificate-based authentication for automated processes.

5\. Security Policies for Password Alternatives
-----------------------------------------------

-   **Regular Updates:** Rotate certificates and tokens periodically.
-   **Backup Mechanisms:** Provide alternative access if biometrics or tokens fail.
-   **Secure Storage:** Protect private keys, certificates, and biometric data.

6\. Comparison of Methods
-------------------------

Compare security methods based on deployment, scalability, and effectiveness.

7\. Verification Commands
-------------------------

-   **For Local Passwords:**
    
    show running-config | include username
                
    
-   **For Certificates:**
    
    show crypto key mypubkey rsa
                
    
-   **For MFA Configuration:** Check RADIUS/TACACS+ integration.

8\. Best Practices
------------------

-   Strengthen passwords by enforcing complexity policies.
-   Deploy MFA for sensitive systems and remote access.
-   Use certificates for secure, scalable authentication.
-   Leverage biometrics for user convenience in secure environments.
-   Conduct regular audits to update authentication policies and configurations.

5.5 IPsec Remote Access and Site-to-Site VPNs
=============================================

Site-to-Site VPN Options
------------------------

-   **IPsec Tunnel:** Open standard IPSec tunnel. Does not support multicast.
-   **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) over IPsec Tunnel:** Adds support for multicast.
-   **IPsec VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface):** Cisco proprietary, simplified configuration. Supports multicast.
-   **DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN):** Cisco proprietary, scalable hub-and-spoke configuration. Enables direct full mesh connectivity between all sites.
-   **FlexVPN:** Cisco proprietary, similar to DMVPN, newer technology.
-   **GETVPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN):** Cisco proprietary, scalable centralized policy for VPNs over non-public infrastructure (e.g., MPLS).

Cisco Example – Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
-------------------------------------------------------

The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is a remote access VPN application that uses the ASA firewall and TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### Tunneling Options:

-   **Split Tunneling:** Internet traffic and corporate traffic are routed through different tunnels. Provides better performance.
-   **Full Tunneling:** Both internet and corporate traffic go through the same VPN tunnel, enforcing uniform security policies across all traffic.

---

5.6 Configure and Verify Access Control Lists
=============================================

1\. Overview of Access Control Lists (ACLs)
-------------------------------------------

-   **Definition:** ACLs are rule-based filters used on routers and switches to permit or deny traffic based on criteria such as IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers.
-   **Purpose:**
    -   Control traffic flow within a network.
    -   Enhance security by restricting unauthorized access.
    -   Optimize bandwidth by limiting unnecessary traffic.
-   **Types of ACLs:**
    -   **Standard ACL:** Filters traffic based only on the source IP address. Range: 1-99 and 1300-1999 (expanded range).
    -   **Extended ACL:** Filters traffic based on source IP, destination IP, protocol, and ports. Range: 100-199 and 2000-2699 (expanded range).

2\. Structure of an ACL
-----------------------

Each ACL contains one or more access control entries (ACEs), also known as rules. ACLs are processed sequentially, starting from the top. A default implicit deny is applied if no rules match the traffic.

3\. ACL Configuration Steps
---------------------------

1.  **Step 1: Create an ACL**
    
    Define the rules to permit or deny traffic.
    
    ### Standard ACL Syntax:
    
    access-list <number> {permit | deny} <source-IP> \[wildcard-mask\]
    
    Example:
    
    access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
    
    ### Extended ACL Syntax:
    
    access-list <number> {permit | deny} <protocol> <source-IP> \[wildcard-mask\] <destination-IP> \[wildcard-mask\] \[eq <port>\]
    
    Example:
    
    access-list 110 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443
    
2.  **Step 2: Apply the ACL to an Interface**
    
    ACLs must be applied to an interface for them to take effect.
    
    ip access-group <ACL-number> {in | out}
    
    Example:
    
    interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    
    ip access-group 10 in
    

4\. Verification of ACLs
------------------------

-   **Commands:**
    -   View configured ACLs:
        
        show access-lists
        
    -   View ACLs applied to an interface:
        
        show ip interface GigabitEthernet0/1
        

5\. Wildcard Masks
------------------

Wildcard masks determine which bits of an IP address are significant. Formula: Wildcard mask = Inverted subnet mask.

Examples:

-   Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 → Wildcard mask: 0.0.0.255
-   Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 → Wildcard mask: 0.0.255.255

Shortcut:

-   **any:** Matches all IP addresses (0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255).
-   **host:** Matches a single IP address (<IP> 0.0.0.0).

6\. Types of Traffic Controlled by ACLs
---------------------------------------

-   **Inbound Traffic:** ACL checks traffic before routing. Denied traffic is dropped immediately.
-   **Outbound Traffic:** ACL checks traffic after routing but before forwarding out.

7\. Extended ACL Protocol and Port Matching
-------------------------------------------

**Protocols:** Common ones include ip, tcp, udp, icmp, and ipx.

**Ports:** Specify a service by port number or name (e.g., 80 or http).

8\. Named ACLs
--------------

Named ACLs allow using descriptive names instead of numbers.

### Syntax:

ip access-list {standard | extended} <name>

### Add rules:

{permit | deny} <protocol> <source-IP> <wildcard-mask> <destination-IP> <wildcard-mask> \[eq <port>\]

Example:

ip access-list extended Block\_HTTP

deny tcp any any eq 80

permit ip any any

Apply the ACL:

interface GigabitEthernet0/1

ip access-group Block\_HTTP in

9\. Best Practices
------------------

-   **Be Specific:** Use precise rules to avoid unintentionally blocking legitimate traffic.
-   **Order Rules Effectively:** Place the most frequently matched rules at the top for efficiency.
-   **Test ACLs in a Lab:** Validate ACLs in a non-production environment.
-   **Document Rules:** Record the purpose of each ACL for future reference.
-   **Monitor and Update:** Regularly review ACLs to ensure they align with current network policies.

10\. Common Issues and Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------

-   **Implicit Deny:** All traffic is denied if no matching rule exists. Always include a final permit ip any any if required.
-   **Incorrect Wildcard Mask:** Misconfigured masks can block unintended traffic. Double-check calculations for accuracy.
-   **Interface Mismatch:** Ensure the ACL is applied to the correct interface and direction.
-   **Order of Rules:** Rules are processed top-down. An overly permissive rule above restrictive ones can nullify the latter.
-   **Use Debug Commands:** Example:
    
    debug ip packet detail
    
    \- Monitors packet matching against ACLs (use cautiously in production).

5.7 Configure and Verify Layer 2 Security Features (DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and Port Security)
=============================================================================================================

Layer 2 Security Features
-------------------------

Layer 2 security features are essential for protecting against attacks that target vulnerabilities at the data link layer of the OSI model. These attacks can involve DHCP, ARP, and port security issues.

### 1\. DHCP Snooping

-   **Definition:** DHCP Snooping is a security feature that acts as a firewall between untrusted DHCP clients and trusted DHCP servers. It ensures that DHCP messages are only forwarded from authorized servers and prevents rogue DHCP servers from handing out invalid IP addresses.
-   **How It Works:**
    -   Creates a table of trusted DHCP servers (trusted interfaces) and untrusted DHCP clients (untrusted interfaces).
    -   The switch only allows DHCP offers, requests, and acknowledgements from trusted ports.
    -   It drops DHCP packets from untrusted ports to prevent malicious activity.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   Enable DHCP Snooping: `Switch# ip dhcp snooping`
    -   Configure Trusted Ports: `Switch(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/1`, `Switch(config-if)# ip dhcp snooping trust`
    -   Configure Untrusted Ports: `Switch(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/2`, `Switch(config-if)# no ip dhcp snooping trust`
    -   Verify DHCP Snooping: `Switch# show ip dhcp snooping`
-   **Benefits:**
    -   Prevents rogue DHCP servers.
    -   Protects against DHCP starvation and DHCP spoofing attacks.

### 2\. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)

-   **Definition:** DAI helps prevent ARP spoofing/poisoning attacks by ensuring that only valid ARP requests and responses are relayed within the network.
-   **How It Works:**
    -   DAI uses the DHCP snooping binding table to validate ARP packets. If the source MAC address does not match the one in the DHCP snooping database, the packet is dropped.
    -   This validation ensures that only legitimate ARP requests and replies are forwarded.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   Enable DAI: `Switch(config)# ip arp inspection vlan <vlan-id>`
    -   Configure Trust on Ports: `Switch(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/1`, `Switch(config-if)# ip arp inspection trust`
    -   Verify DAI: `Switch# show ip arp inspection`
-   **Benefits:**
    -   Prevents ARP poisoning and MitM attacks.
    -   Ensures data integrity by verifying ARP packet authenticity.

### 3\. Port Security

-   **Definition:** Port Security restricts access to switch ports based on MAC addresses, helping prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
-   **How It Works:**
    -   Specifies the allowed MAC addresses on each switch port. When a violation occurs, the switch takes the configured action (e.g., shutdown, restrict).
-   **Port Security Modes:**
    -   Protect: Drops packets from unauthorized MAC addresses without notification.
    -   Restrict: Drops packets from unauthorized MAC addresses and sends a notification.
    -   Shutdown: Shuts down the port when an unauthorized MAC address is detected.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   Enable Port Security: `Switch(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/1`, `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security`
    -   Set Maximum Number of MAC Addresses: `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum <number>`
    -   Set Violation Action: `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation <shutdown | restrict | protect>`
    -   Configure Static MAC Address: `Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address <mac-address>`
    -   Verify Port Security: `Switch# show port-security interface gigabitethernet0/1`
-   **Benefits:**
    -   Prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the network.
    -   Helps mitigate MAC flooding attacks by limiting the number of MAC addresses on a port.

### 4\. Best Practices for Layer 2 Security

-   Enable DHCP Snooping on All VLANs to block rogue DHCP servers.
-   Use Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) to protect against ARP spoofing and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
-   Configure Port Security by limiting the number of MAC addresses per port.
-   Secure All Access Switch Ports by applying port security to restrict access to authorized devices.
-   Monitor and Audit Layer 2 Security Features regularly and use logs to track security violations.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Layer 2 Security

-   Verify DHCP Snooping Binding Table: `Switch# show ip dhcp snooping binding`
-   Verify Dynamic ARP Inspection: `Switch# show ip arp inspection`
-   Check Port Security Violations: `Switch# show port-security interface gigabitethernet0/1`
-   Check Logs for Security Alerts and monitor for unauthorized DHCP servers.

### 6\. Summary

-   DHCP Snooping prevents rogue DHCP servers by restricting DHCP traffic to trusted interfaces.
-   Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) prevents ARP spoofing attacks by validating ARP packets with the DHCP binding table.
-   Port Security limits the number of devices per port and prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the network.
