# CCNA 200-301 Exam Notes: 1.0 Network Fundamentals

## 1.1 Explain the Role and Function of Network Components

### OSI Layers and Network Services

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions. It consists of 7 layers, each with its specific role in handling communication:

- **Application Layer**: 
  - Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
  - Examples: HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP.
  
- **Presentation Layer**: 
  - Ensures data is properly formatted, encrypted, and compressed for transmission.
  - Examples: Encryption protocols (SSL/TLS), data formats (JPEG, ASCII).

- **Session Layer**: 
  - Manages and controls the dialog between two systems, establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions.
  - Examples: NetBIOS, RPC.

- **Transport Layer**: 
  - Provides reliable data transfer, error correction, flow control, and segmentation.
  - Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
  
- **Network Layer**: 
  - Handles logical addressing, routing, and path selection across networks.
  - Protocols: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

- **Data Link Layer**: 
  - Responsible for framing, addressing (MAC), and error detection on the local network.
  - Protocols: Ethernet, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

- **Physical Layer**: 
  - Deals with the physical transmission of binary data over the network media (wires, fiber, radio).
  - Examples: Electrical signals, optical signals, radio frequencies.

### Protocol Data Units (PDU)

Each layer in the OSI model adds a specific header to data, encapsulating it as it moves down the layers:

- **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**: Bits — Transmission of raw binary data over physical media.
- **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: Frames — Data is packaged with MAC addresses for local delivery.
- **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**: Packets — Data is encapsulated with logical addressing (IP addresses).
- **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Segments — Data is divided into segments for reliable transmission.

#### Encapsulation Process:

- **Segment**: Encapsulates application layer data (Layers 5-7).
- **Packet**: Encapsulates transport layer segments (Layer 4).
- **Frame**: Encapsulates network layer packets (Layer 3).
- **Physical Layer**: Converts frames and packets to binary bits for transmission over the network medium.

### TCP/IP Reference Model vs. OSI Model

| TCP/IP Model         | OSI Model                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Application Layer** | Session, Presentation, Application Layers |
| **Transport Layer**   | Transport Layer                |
| **Internet Layer**    | Network Layer                  |
| **Network Access Layer** | Data Link Layer, Physical Layer |

The TCP/IP model is more simplified, combining some of the OSI layers, such as the Application Layer merging the functionalities of OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers.

### Network Devices and OSI Layers

Each network device operates at a specific layer of the OSI model. Understanding their roles helps in troubleshooting and network design.

- **Firewall**: 
  - Primarily operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer), though can filter traffic based on lower layers as well.
  
- **Wireless Access Point (AP)**: 
  - Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) to connect wireless devices to a wired network.

- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**: 
  - Operates at Layer 2 to manage access points, ensuring consistent network access across multiple APs.

- **Switch**: 
  - Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) to switch frames between devices within the same network.
  
- **Router**: 
  - Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer), routing packets between different subnets and networks.
  
- **Bridge**: 
  - Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer), connecting two network segments and managing traffic between them.

### 1.1.a What is a Router?

- A **Router** is a device that forwards packets between networks or subnets based on IP addresses.
- Routers do not forward traffic automatically unless configured with routing rules.
- **Firewall** devices can inspect traffic up to Layer 7 and may offer routing capabilities as well, ensuring security across network boundaries.

### 1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switches

- **Layer 2 Switch**:
  - Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2), using MAC addresses to forward frames within the same LAN or VLAN.
  - Does not route traffic between different subnets.

- **Layer 3 Switch**:
  - Functions like a router but with more limited routing features. It can forward packets between different subnets and perform routing within a local network.

### 1.1.c Next-Generation Firewalls and IPS

- **Firewall**:
  - Protects the network from unauthorized access and malicious attacks (viruses, ransomware, phishing).
  
- **Next-Generation Firewalls**:
  - Go beyond traditional packet filtering, providing advanced capabilities such as application-level inspection, intrusion prevention, and user-based security.
  - Example: Cisco ASA with FirePower integration.
  - Includes features like deep packet inspection up to Layer 7, inspecting not just headers but the entire content of data packets.

- **Packet Filters**:
  - A basic form of firewall using Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic based on IP address and port number without connection tracking.

- **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)**:
  - IDS detects suspicious activities using predefined signatures and anomaly detection techniques.
  - IPS not only detects but also prevents attacks by blocking harmful traffic.
  - Requires skilled personnel to manage false positives and negatives, ensuring system security without hindering legitimate traffic.

### 1.1.d Access Points (AP)

- **Access Points** convert electrical signals to electromagnetic waves and vice versa, allowing wireless devices to connect to the network.
- APs extend the coverage of a network and support communication between wired and wireless devices.

### 1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)

- **Cisco DNA Center**:
  - An SDN (Software-Defined Networking) controller that simplifies network management by centralizing the configuration and monitoring of devices.
  - Helps automate network operations and improve network security in enterprise environments.

- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**:
  - Manages and configures multiple access points from a central location.
  - **Autonomous vs. Lightweight APs**:
    - **Autonomous APs**: Standalone devices with full functionality.
    - **Lightweight APs**: Rely on a WLC for configuration and management.
  - **CAPWAP Protocol**: Used by lightweight APs to communicate with WLC over UDP ports 5246/5247.
  - **Split-MAC Architecture**: APs handle real-time traffic processing, while WLC manages control plane operations (configuration, monitoring).
  - **FlexConnect**: Allows APs in branch offices to forward local traffic directly without routing through the central WLC.

### 1.1.f Endpoints

- **Endpoints** refer to devices like PCs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets that interact with the network to access applications, transmit, and receive data.
- Endpoints are crucial for providing users with network services and applications.

### 1.1.g Servers

- **Servers** host applications, databases, and other resources for endpoints.
- They provide centralized resources and services that are accessed by client devices across the network.

### 1.1.h Power over Ethernet (PoE)

- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)** allows network cables (Ethernet) to deliver both data and power to devices such as IP phones, access points, and cameras.
- PoE simplifies infrastructure by reducing the need for separate power cables for each device.

### 1.2.e Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)

- LAN technologies: DSL, cable, wireless (4G/5G).
- Typically lacks corporate SLAs.

### 1.2.f On-Premises and Cloud

- **On-Premises**:
    - Equipment located in-house and owned by the organization.
    - Requires capital expenditure and maintenance.
- **Cloud**:
    - Shared, on-demand computing resources.
    - Reduces equipment and maintenance costs.

**Colocation Facilities**:

# CCNA 200-301 Notes

## 1.5 Compare TCP to UDP

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
    - Connection-oriented with handshake setup.
    - Provides flow control and sequencing.
    - Includes error recovery and retransmission (detects, prevents, and corrects packet drops).
    - Less efficient due to increased overhead and packet processing.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
    - Connectionless, no guarantee of packet delivery (best effort).
    - Only checks for errors via CRC/FCS checksum, discards erroneous datagrams.
    - Faster than TCP with lower latency due to no retransmission.
    - Ideal for applications like video streaming where speed is prioritized over reliability.

---

### Inter-Application Communication:
- The **session ID** facilitates logical communication between each application process.
- **OSI Session Layer**: Handles session setup and teardown.
- Each file download session has a unique session ID.
- The **port number** (socket number) identifies each application on a server.
- The server uses the port number to route packets to the appropriate application.

### Table 2: TCP/UDP Port Assignment
| Protocol | Port   | Type  |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Telnet   | TCP 23 | TCP   |
| SMTP     | TCP 25 | TCP   |
| FTP      | TCP 21 | TCP   |
| HTTP     | TCP 80 | TCP   |
| SNMP     | UDP 161| UDP   |
| DNS      | TCP/UDP 53 | Both  |
| HTTPS    | TCP 443| TCP   |
| SSH      | TCP 22 | TCP   |
| TFTP     | UDP 69 | UDP   |

---

## 1.6 Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting

- **IPv4 Addressing**:
    - IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, written as `x.x.x.x` (octets).
    - A router's interface must be manually enabled with `no shut`.

---

### Subnetting

- **Classful Addressing**:
    - Uses predefined address classes (A, B, C).
    - **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Allows splitting addresses into smaller subnets without strict class boundaries. Example: `172.10.10.10/20 = 172.10.10.10 255.255.240.0`.
  
- **Subnetting**:
    - Borrow host bits to create subnets.
    - The number of subnets can be calculated as `2^subnet-bits`.
    - The number of hosts per subnet: `(2^host-bits - 2)` (subtracting 2 for network and broadcast addresses).
  
    **Example Calculations**:
    - Class C /28 subnet: `2^4 = 16 subnets`, `2^4 - 2 = 14 hosts`.
    - Class B /28 subnet: `2^12 = 4096 subnets`, `2^12 - 2 = 4094 hosts`.

---

### Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)

- **VLSM**: Allows subnets of varying sizes based on required host numbers.
- **Design Considerations**:
    - Prioritize larger subnets first.
    - Leave space for future growth.
    - Example: Design for engineering departments requiring 28 hosts, sales departments needing 14 and 7 hosts, and router links.

---

### Private IPv4 Addressing

- **RFC 1918** specifies private address ranges, not routable on the internet.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Maps private IPs to public IPs to allow internet access.

#### Private Address Ranges:
- **Class A**: `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255` (`10.0.0.0/8`)
- **Class B**: `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255` (`172.16.0.0/12`)
- **Class C**: `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` (`192.168.0.0/16`)

---

## 1.7 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix

- **IPv6 Configuration**: 
    - Command: `ipv6 unicast-routing`
    - To verify: `show ipv6 interface brief`

- **IPv6 Addressing Format**:
    - Uses a 128-bit address: `X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X` (hexadecimal fields).
    - Example: `2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001`
    - Shorten addresses by removing leading zeros and collapsing consecutive zero fields (e.g., `2001:DB8:0:1::1`).

---

### Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC)

- **SLAAC**: Hosts configure their own IPv6 addresses based on the network prefix advertised by routers.
- **DHCPv6**: Can also be used for stateful addressing.
- **Router Advertisements**: Sent to hosts to inform them of the network prefix.

---

### Neighbour Discovery (ND)
- IPv6 equivalent of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
- Uses ICMP Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement.

---

## 1.8 Describe IPv6 Address Types

- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication.
    - **Global Unicast Addresses (GUA)**: Similar to IPv4 public addresses, globally reachable.
    - **Unique Local Addresses (ULA)**: Private, non-routable, similar to IPv4 RFC 1918 addresses.
    - **Link Local Addresses (LLA)**: Only valid within the local network segment.
  
- **Anycast**: One-to-nearest communication (delivered to the closest interface).
  
- **Multicast**: One-to-many communication (delivered to a group of interfaces).

---

### Modified EUI-64

- IPv6 addresses can be derived from the MAC address using EUI-64, which includes `FF:FE` in the middle and inverts the 7th bit.

---

## 1.9 Verify IP Parameters for Client OS

- **Windows**: `ipconfig`
- **Mac/Linux**: `ifconfig`

---

## 1.11 Describe Wireless Principles

### WLANs and CSMA/CD

- WLANs cannot use CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) because wireless communication is half-duplex.
- This means a device cannot transmit and receive data simultaneously.

### 1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi Channels

- At 2.4 GHz, the best non-overlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11.
- Each channel on the 2.4 GHz spectrum is 20 MHz wide.
- The channels are separated by 5 MHz, and the entire spectrum spans only 100 MHz.
- 5 GHz channels are 20 MHz wide with less overlap than 2.4 GHz channels.
- Neighboring Access Points (APs) should be separated by at least one channel.

### 1.11.b SSID

- SSID stands for Service Set Identifier, a unique name shared among devices on the same network.
- In public places, the SSID is set on the AP and broadcast to wireless devices in range.
- SSIDs are case-sensitive text strings, and their maximum length is 32 characters.
- In Linksys APs, the default SSID is typically "linksys".

### 1.11.c RF

- RF (Radio Frequency) refers to the wireless channels and radio frequencies used by wireless devices and APs.

### 1.11.d Encryption

Wireless security standards include:

- **WEP (1999)**: RC4 encryption.
- **WPA (2003)**: RC4 encryption with TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- **WPA2 (2004)**: AES encryption with CCMP (Counter Cipher Mode with Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol).
- **WPA3 (2018)**: AES encryption with CCMP and protection against the KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) vulnerability.

**WPA Personal vs WPA Enterprise**:

- **WPA Personal** uses Pre-shared Keys (

## 1.13 Describe Switching Concepts

### 1.13.a MAC Learning and Aging

- **MAC Learning**: When a switch receives a frame, it learns the source MAC address and associates it with the incoming port. This builds the MAC address table for efficient forwarding of frames.
- **MAC Aging**: To keep the MAC address table up-to-date, entries are removed after a set period if no traffic is received from a MAC address. This ensures that the table reflects the current network state.

**Example Scenario**:
- **Initial State**: MAC Address Table is empty.
- **Frame Reception**:
  - Frame from Device A arrives on Port 1; switch learns MAC_A and associates it with Port 1.
  - Similar process for Devices B and C.
- **After Learning**: The MAC Address Table is updated as:
  - MAC_A: Port 1
  - MAC_B: Port 2
  - MAC_C: Port 3

- **MAC Aging** works by removing entries that haven’t been updated in a set time, e.g., 300 seconds.

**Example Aging Process**:
- If MAC_A hasn’t been updated for 5 minutes, it is removed from the table.
- Remaining entries are retained if updated recently.

### 1.13.b Frame Switching

- **Switching Decision**: When a frame is received, the switch checks the destination MAC address in its MAC address table and forwards the frame to the corresponding port.
  
**Store-and-Forward vs Cut-Through Switching**:
- **Store-and-Forward**: Entire frame is received before forwarding; error-checking is performed.
- **Cut-Through**: Forwarding starts as soon as the destination MAC address is determined, reducing latency but without error-checking.

### 1.13.c Frame Flooding

- **Frame Flooding**: Occurs when a switch receives a broadcast or unknown unicast frame (a frame with a destination MAC address not in the MAC table). The frame is forwarded to all ports except the one it was received on.
- **Reducing Frame Flooding**: Techniques like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) are used to eliminate loops and minimize unnecessary flooding.

### 1.13.d MAC Address Table

- The **MAC Address Table** (CAM Table) contains entries that associate MAC addresses with switch ports.
  - **Dynamic Entries** are learned through the MAC learning process.
  - **Static Entries** are manually configured by administrators to associate specific MAC addresses with ports permanently.
