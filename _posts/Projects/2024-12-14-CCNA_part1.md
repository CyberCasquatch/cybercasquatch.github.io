## 1.1 Explain the Role and Function of Network Components

### OSI Layers and Network Services

- **Application Layer**: Network services to applications.
- **Presentation Layer**: Data formatting, translation, encryption, encoding.
- **Session Layer**: Logical communication between host processes.
- **Transport Layer**: Windowing, error recovery, segments, reliability.
- **Network Layer**: Logical addressing, routing, path selection.
- **Data Link Layer**: Framing, media access control (MAC address).
- **Physical Layer**: Binary bits on physical media.

### Protocol Data Units (PDU)

Encapsulation process:

- **Layer 1**: Bits
- **Layer 2**: Frames
- **Layer 3**: Packets
- **Layer 4**: Segments

Encapsulation:

- Segment encapsulates data from layers 5-7.

- Frame encapsulates network layer packets.
- Physical layer converts all to binary bits for transmission.

### TCP/IP Reference Model vs. OSI Model

| TCP/IP Model         | OSI Model                |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Application Layer    | Session, Presentation, Application |
| Transport Layer      | Transport Layer          |
| Internet Layer       | Network Layer            |
| Network Layer        | Data Link Layer, Physical Layer |

### Network Devices and OSI Layers

- **Firewall**: Layer 7
- **Wireless Access Point (AP)**: Layer 2
- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**: Layer 2
- **Switch**: Layer 2
- **Router**: Layer 3
- **Bridge**: Layer 2

#### 1.1.a What is a Router?

- Routes packets between subnets.
- Does not forward traffic automatically.
- Firewalls inspect up to Layer 7 and can also provide routing services.

#### 1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switches

- **Layer 2 Switch**: Moves packets within the same LAN/VLAN.
- **Layer 3 Switch**: Acts like a router with limited routing features.

#### 1.1.c Next-Generation Firewalls and IPS

- **Firewall**: Protects networks from attacks (viruses, ransomware, phishing).
- **Next-Gen Firewalls**: Add application-level inspection, intrusion prevention, user-based security.
    - Cisco ASA with FirePower as an example.
    - Deep packet inspection up to Layer 7.
- **Packet Filters**: ACL-based filters without connection tracking.
- **IDS/IPS**: 
    - Use signatures and anomaly detection for Layer 7 traffic analysis.
    - Require skilled staff to reduce false positives and negatives.

#### 1.1.d Access Points

#### 1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)

- **Cisco DNA Center**: SDN controller for enterprise environments.
- **WLC**: Centralized access point management.
    - Autonomous vs. Lightweight APs.
    - Lightweight APs use CAPWAP protocol (UDP ports 5246/5247).
    - Split-MAC architecture: Real-time traffic handled by AP, management tasks by WLC.
    - FlexConnect for local traffic forwarding in branch offices.

#### 1.1.f Endpoints

- Examples: PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones.
- Request application access and transmit data across the network.

- **1000BASE-T**: 1 Gbps.
- **10GBASE-T**: 10 Gbps.

## 1.11 Describe Wireless Principles

### WLANs and CSMA/CD

- WLANs cannot use CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) because wireless communication is half-duplex.
- This means a device cannot transmit and receive data simultaneously.

### 1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi Channels

- At 2.4 GHz, the best non-overlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11.
- Each channel on the 2.4 GHz spectrum is 20 MHz wide.
- The channels are separated by 5 MHz, and the entire spectrum spans only 100 MHz.
- 5 GHz channels are 20 MHz wide with less overlap than 2.4 GHz channels.
- Neighboring Access Points (APs) should be separated by at least one channel.

### 1.11.b SSID

- SSID stands for Service Set Identifier, a unique name shared among devices on the same network.
- In public places, the SSID is set on the AP and broadcast to wireless devices in range.
- SSIDs are case-sensitive text strings, and their maximum length is 32 characters.
- In Linksys APs, the default SSID is typically "linksys".

### 1.11.c RF

- RF (Radio Frequency) refers to the wireless channels and radio frequencies used by wireless devices and APs.

### 1.11.d Encryption

Wireless security standards include:

- **WEP (1999)**: RC4 encryption.
- **WPA (2003)**: RC4 encryption with TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- **WPA2 (2004)**: AES encryption with CCMP (Counter Cipher Mode with Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol).
- **WPA3 (2018)**: AES encryption with CCMP and protection against the KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) vulnerability.

**WPA Personal vs WPA Enterprise**:

- **WPA Personal** uses Pre-shared Keys (

## 1.13 Describe Switching Concepts

### 1.13.a MAC Learning and Aging

- **MAC Learning**: When a switch receives a frame, it learns the source MAC address and associates it with the incoming port. This builds the MAC address table for efficient forwarding of frames.
- **MAC Aging**: To keep the MAC address table up-to-date, entries are removed after a set period if no traffic is received from a MAC address. This ensures that the table reflects the current network state.

**Example Scenario**:
- **Initial State**: MAC Address Table is empty.
- **Frame Reception**:
  - Frame from Device A arrives on Port 1; switch learns MAC_A and associates it with Port 1.
  - Similar process for Devices B and C.
- **After Learning**: The MAC Address Table is updated as:
  - MAC_A: Port 1
  - MAC_B: Port 2
  - MAC_C: Port 3

- **MAC Aging** works by removing entries that haven’t been updated in a set time, e.g., 300 seconds.

**Example Aging Process**:
- If MAC_A hasn’t been updated for 5 minutes, it is removed from the table.
- Remaining entries are retained if updated recently.

### 1.13.b Frame Switching

- **Switching Decision**: When a frame is received, the switch checks the destination MAC address in its MAC address table and forwards the frame to the corresponding port.
  
**Store-and-Forward vs Cut-Through Switching**:
- **Store-and-Forward**: Entire frame is received before forwarding; error-checking is performed.
- **Cut-Through**: Forwarding starts as soon as the destination MAC address is determined, reducing latency but without error-checking.

### 1.13.c Frame Flooding

- **Frame Flooding**: Occurs when a switch receives a broadcast or unknown unicast frame (a frame with a destination MAC address not in the MAC table). The frame is forwarded to all ports except the one it was received on.
- **Reducing Frame Flooding**: Techniques like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) are used to eliminate loops and minimize unnecessary flooding.

### 1.13.d MAC Address Table

- The **MAC Address Table** (CAM Table) contains entries that associate MAC addresses with switch ports.
  - **Dynamic Entries** are learned through the MAC learning process.
  - **Static Entries** are manually configured by administrators to associate specific MAC addresses with ports permanently.
