# CCNA 200-301 Exam Notes: 3.0 IP Connectivity

# 3.0 – IP Connectivity

## 3.1 Interpret the Components of a Routing Table

A router's **routing table** holds the best available path (or paths) to a destination network. It is used for forwarding traffic across the network. The table consists of directly connected networks, statically configured routes, and dynamically learned routes via routing protocols. Each entry in the routing table provides critical information that helps the router determine the most efficient path to forward packets.

### Key Components of a Routing Table:

---

## 3.1.a Routing Protocol Code

Routing protocol codes identify the source of the route in the routing table. They indicate how the router learned about the path to the destination network. Common routing protocol codes include:

- **C**: **Connected Route** – A route to a network directly connected to one of the router’s interfaces.
- **S**: **Static Route** – A manually configured route set by the network administrator.
- **R**: **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** – A distance-vector protocol that uses hop count to determine the best path.
- **O**: **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** – A link-state protocol that uses cost (based on bandwidth) to determine the best path.
- **EIGRP**: **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol** – A hybrid protocol that combines aspects of distance-vector and link-state protocols.
- **D**: **EIGRP-derived Route** – A route learned through EIGRP.

These codes help the router distinguish how a route was learned and its source.

## 3.1.b Prefix

The **prefix** is the network address or destination of a route. It represents the network portion of the IP address and is essential for identifying the route’s destination.

**Example**:  
`192.168.1.0` represents a network address for the route.

The prefix is commonly paired with the network mask (subnet mask) to specify the network and determine the valid IP addresses within the network range.

---

## 3.1.c Network Mask

The **network mask** (or **subnet mask**) defines the range of IP addresses that belong to a particular route. It tells the router which portion of the IP address corresponds to the network and which portion corresponds to the host.

**Example**:  
- `255.255.255.0` (or `/24`) is a typical subnet mask that signifies a network with up to 256 possible addresses (including network and broadcast addresses).

The mask helps the router in identifying whether a destination IP address is part of the directly connected network or requires forwarding to another router.

---

## 3.1.d Next Hop

The **next hop** is the IP address of the next router in the path that packets should be forwarded to. It serves as an intermediate router where the packet will be sent before continuing towards its final destination.

**Example**:  
- If the **next hop** is `192.168.2.1`, the router will forward the packet to this address for further processing.

The **next hop** ensures that packets are directed correctly across the network towards their destination.

---

## 3.1.e Administrative Distance (AD)

**Administrative Distance (AD)** is a value used to rank the trustworthiness of a route. The lower the AD, the more reliable the route is considered. Each routing protocol has a default AD that helps the router decide which route to prefer if multiple routes to the same destination exist.

**Common AD values**:
- **0**: Connected Routes – Directly connected networks are the most trusted.
- **1**: Static Routes – Manually configured routes are highly trusted.
- **90**: EIGRP – Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol routes are moderately trusted.
- **110**: OSPF – Open Shortest Path First routes are also moderately trusted.
- **120**: RIP – Routing Information Protocol routes are less trusted due to its reliance on hop count.
- **255**: Unreachable Route – Indicates that a route is not available.

The AD helps the router determine which path to take when multiple protocols provide routes to the same destination.

---

## 3.1.f Metric

A **metric** is a value that helps the router determine the **cost** of a route. The lower the metric, the more preferred the route is. Different routing protocols use different methods to calculate the metric.

- **RIP**: Hop count – the number of routers a packet has to pass through before reaching the destination. Lower hop counts are preferred.
- **OSPF**: Cost – the cost is based on bandwidth, with lower costs being preferred for faster links.
- **EIGRP**: Composite metric – it combines factors such as bandwidth, delay, and reliability to compute the best path.

The metric is used to evaluate the "cost" of a route, helping the router make the best choice for routing traffic.

---

## 3.1.g Gateway of Last Resort

The **Gateway of Last Resort** is used as a fallback route when no specific match is found in the routing table for a packet’s destination. This route is often configured as a **default route** and ensures that packets can still be forwarded to their destination, even if a more specific route is unavailable.

- **IPv4 Default Route**: `0.0.0.0/0`
- **IPv6 Default Route**: `::/0`

The Gateway of Last Resort is typically set up as a static route, or it can be learned through a dynamic routing protocol.

---

### Example Routing Table Entries:

Here are some example entries you might find in a routing table:

- `C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1`
    - **C**: The network `192.168.1.0/24` is directly connected to the router through interface `GigabitEthernet0/1`.
  
- `O 10.1.1.0/24 [110/2] via 192.168.2.1, 00:00:22, GigabitEthernet0/0`
    - **O**: The route `10.1.1.0/24` is learned via OSPF with an AD of `110`. The metric is `2`, and the next hop is `192.168.2.1`. The route was last updated 22 seconds ago, and it is reachable via interface `GigabitEthernet0/0`.
  
- `S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 192.168.2.1`
    - **S**: A static route (configured by the network administrator) that serves as the default route (`0.0.0.0/0`). It points to the next hop `192.168.2.1`, and has an AD of `1`.

These components of a routing table work together to help the router determine the best path to forward packets efficiently, taking into account network topology, trustworthiness of routes, and the cost of each route.
