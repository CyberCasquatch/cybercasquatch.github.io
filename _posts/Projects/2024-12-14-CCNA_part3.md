# 3.0 – IP Connectivity

## 3.1 Interpret the Components of a Routing Table

A router's **routing table** holds the best available path (or paths) to a destination network. It is used for forwarding traffic across the network. The table consists of directly connected networks, statically configured routes, and dynamically learned routes via routing protocols. Each entry in the routing table provides critical information that helps the router determine the most efficient path to forward packets.

### Key Components of a Routing Table:

---

## 3.1.a Routing Protocol Code

Routing protocol codes identify the source of the route in the routing table. They indicate how the router learned about the path to the destination network. Common routing protocol codes include:

- **C**: **Connected Route** – A route to a network directly connected to one of the router’s interfaces.
- **S**: **Static Route** – A manually configured route set by the network administrator.
- **R**: **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** – A distance-vector protocol that uses hop count to determine the best path.
- **O**: **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** – A link-state protocol that uses cost (based on bandwidth) to determine the best path.
- **EIGRP**: **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol** – A hybrid protocol that combines aspects of distance-vector and link-state protocols.
- **D**: **EIGRP-derived Route** – A route learned through EIGRP.

These codes help the router distinguish how a route was learned and its source.

## 3.1.b Prefix

The **prefix** is the network address or destination of a route. It represents the network portion of the IP address and is essential for identifying the route’s destination.

**Example**:  
`192.168.1.0` represents a network address for the route.

The prefix is commonly paired with the network mask (subnet mask) to specify the network and determine the valid IP addresses within the network range.

---

## 3.1.c Network Mask

The **network mask** (or **subnet mask**) defines the range of IP addresses that belong to a particular route. It tells the router which portion of the IP address corresponds to the network and which portion corresponds to the host.

**Example**:  
- `255.255.255.0` (or `/24`) is a typical subnet mask that signifies a network with up to 256 possible addresses (including network and broadcast addresses).

The mask helps the router in identifying whether a destination IP address is part of the directly connected network or requires forwarding to another router.

---

## 3.1.d Next Hop

The **next hop** is the IP address of the next router in the path that packets should be forwarded to. It serves as an intermediate router where the packet will be sent before continuing towards its final destination.

**Example**:  
- If the **next hop** is `192.168.2.1`, the router will forward the packet to this address for further processing.

The **next hop** ensures that packets are directed correctly across the network towards their destination.

---

## 3.1.e Administrative Distance (AD)

**Administrative Distance (AD)** is a value used to rank the trustworthiness of a route. The lower the AD, the more reliable the route is considered. Each routing protocol has a default AD that helps the router decide which route to prefer if multiple routes to the same destination exist.

**Common AD values**:
- **0**: Connected Routes – Directly connected networks are the most trusted.
- **1**: Static Routes – Manually configured routes are highly trusted.
- **90**: EIGRP – Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol routes are moderately trusted.
- **110**: OSPF – Open Shortest Path First routes are also moderately trusted.
- **120**: RIP – Routing Information Protocol routes are less trusted due to its reliance on hop count.
- **255**: Unreachable Route – Indicates that a route is not available.

The AD helps the router determine which path to take when multiple protocols provide routes to the same destination.

---

## 3.1.f Metric

A **metric** is a value that helps the router determine the **cost** of a route. The lower the metric, the more preferred the route is. Different routing protocols use different methods to calculate the metric.

- **RIP**: Hop count – the number of routers a packet has to pass through before reaching the destination. Lower hop counts are preferred.
- **OSPF**: Cost – the cost is based on bandwidth, with lower costs being preferred for faster links.
- **EIGRP**: Composite metric – it combines factors such as bandwidth, delay, and reliability to compute the best path.

The metric is used to evaluate the "cost" of a route, helping the router make the best choice for routing traffic.

---

## 3.1.g Gateway of Last Resort

The **Gateway of Last Resort** is used as a fallback route when no specific match is found in the routing table for a packet’s destination. This route is often configured as a **default route** and ensures that packets can still be forwarded to their destination, even if a more specific route is unavailable.

- **IPv4 Default Route**: `0.0.0.0/0`
- **IPv6 Default Route**: `::/0`

The Gateway of Last Resort is typically set up as a static route, or it can be learned through a dynamic routing protocol.

---

### Example Routing Table Entries:

Here are some example entries you might find in a routing table:

- `C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1`
    - **C**: The network `192.168.1.0/24` is directly connected to the router through interface `GigabitEthernet0/1`.
  
- `O 10.1.1.0/24 [110/2] via 192.168.2.1, 00:00:22, GigabitEthernet0/0`
    - **O**: The route `10.1.1.0/24` is learned via OSPF with an AD of `110`. The metric is `2`, and the next hop is `192.168.2.1`. The route was last updated 22 seconds ago, and it is reachable via interface `GigabitEthernet0/0`.
  
- `S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 192.168.2.1`
    - **S**: A static route (configured by the network administrator) that serves as the default route (`0.0.0.0/0`). It points to the next hop `192.168.2.1`, and has an AD of `1`.

---

These components of a routing table work together to help the router determine the best path to forward packets efficiently, taking into account network topology, trustworthiness of routes, and the cost of each route.

# 3.2 – Determine How a Router Makes a Forwarding Decision by Default

When a router receives a packet, it must determine the best path to the packet's destination. This decision is made by consulting its **routing table** and evaluating various criteria in a specific order. The three primary factors that influence the forwarding decision are:

1. **Longest prefix match**
2. **Administrative distance (AD)**
3. **Routing protocol metric**

These factors are evaluated sequentially to identify the optimal path for forwarding the packet.

---

## 3.2.a Longest Prefix Match

The **longest prefix match** is the first criterion a router uses to select the best route to a destination. It refers to the most specific route available in the routing table. The more bits in the subnet mask that match the destination IP address, the more specific the route is considered.

### Key Points:
- The route with the highest number of matching bits in the subnet mask is selected.
- The **longest prefix** is the most specific match, meaning it covers the smallest range of IP addresses.

**Example**:  
Given a destination IP address of `192.168.1.100`, the routing table has the following entries:

- **192.168.1.0/24** → matches 24 bits
- **192.168.1.64/26** → matches 26 bits (more specific)
- **192.168.81.96/28** → matches 28 bits (most specific)

Since `192.168.81.96/28` matches the most bits (28 bits), the router selects this as the best match for the packet’s destination.

---

## 3.2.b Administrative Distance (AD)

If multiple routes share the same longest prefix, the router then compares their **Administrative Distance (AD)**. The AD is a value that indicates the trustworthiness of a route based on how it was learned. Routes with a lower AD are considered more reliable and are preferred over those with a higher AD.

### Key Points:
- **Lower AD values** are preferred because they indicate a more trusted route.
- **AD** helps the router choose between multiple routes to the same destination when no single route is superior based on prefix length alone.

### Default AD Values:
- **0**: Directly Connected – The most trusted routes.
- **1**: Static Routes – Manually configured by the administrator.
- **90**: EIGRP – Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.
- **110**: OSPF – Open Shortest Path First.
- **120**: RIP – Routing Information Protocol.
- **255**: Unreachable – The route is considered unreachable.

**Example**:  
Consider two routes to the destination `10.1.1.0/24`:
- One route is learned via OSPF, with an AD of **110**.
- The other is learned via EIGRP, with an AD of **90**.

The router will select the **EIGRP** route because it has the lower AD value, making it more trustworthy.

---

## 3.2.c Routing Protocol Metric

If routes have the same prefix length and AD, the router will compare the **metric** of each route to determine the best path. The **metric** is a measure of the "cost" of reaching a destination. Each routing protocol uses different criteria to calculate this cost.

### Key Points:
- **RIP**: The metric is the **hop count**, and fewer hops are preferred.
- **OSPF**: The metric is based on **cost**, which is derived from bandwidth. Higher bandwidth links have a lower cost.
- **EIGRP**: The metric is a **composite value** that takes into account bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load.

**Example**:  
Consider two OSPF routes to the destination `192.168.10.0/24`:

- **Route 1**: Metric = 20
- **Route 2**: Metric = 10

The router will select **Route 2** because it has the lower metric, indicating that it is the less costly route.

---

### Summary of the Forwarding Decision Process:

1. **Longest Prefix Match**: The router first checks the routing table for the most specific match based on the longest prefix (most matching bits).
2. **Administrative Distance**: If multiple routes share the same prefix length, the router compares the AD values. The route with the lowest AD is preferred.
3. **Routing Protocol Metric**: If the ADs are the same, the router compares the metric for each route. The route with the lowest metric (least cost) is chosen.

By evaluating these factors in order, the router makes an informed decision on how to forward a packet towards its destination efficiently.
