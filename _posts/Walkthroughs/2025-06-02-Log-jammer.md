> From HTB:
>  "You have been presented with the opportunity to work as a junior DFIR consultant for a big consultancy. However, they have provided a technical assessment for you to complete. The consultancy Forela-Security would like to gauge your Windows Event Log Analysis knowledge. We believe the Cyberjunkie user logged in to his computer and may have taken malicious actions. Please analyze the given event logs and report back."

### Environments Used
* Windows OS
* Event Log Viewer

_Make sure to download the Logjammer.zip to a safe place to analyse._

The original write-up for this used Splunk - I didn't use that to analyse these files, I just used the windows event viewer and filtered on event IDs.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Event Viewer or a log parser (like `EventLog Explorer`, `Chainsaw`, `Log-MD`, or `wevtx` with PowerShell or Python)
- `.evtx` files:
  - `Security.evtx`
  - `System.evtx`
  - `Windows PowerShell - Operational.evtx`
  - `Windows Defender - Operational.evtx`
  - `Windows Firewall - Firewall.evtx`
