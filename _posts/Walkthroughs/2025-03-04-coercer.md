-----------

Coercing attacks provide a direct path to escalating privileges, often leading to Domain Administrator access. Many organizations running a default Active Directory (AD) setup are at risk. While previous discussions have covered PrinterBug, there are multiple Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functions that can be exploited similarly. Attackers can use these vulnerabilities to compel a remote server to authenticate to any system within the domain. To streamline this process, the Coercer tool was developed to exploit all known vulnerable RPC functions simultaneously.

Once an attacker coerces authentication, they have multiple options, including:

*   Relaying the connection to another Domain Controller to execute a DCSync attack (if SMB signing is disabled).
*   Forcing a Domain Controller to connect to a server configured for Unconstrained Delegation (UD), enabling credential theft via tools like Rubeus and Mimikatz.
*   Relaying authentication to Active Directory Certificate Services to obtain a valid certificate for the Domain Controller, which can be used for privilege escalation.
*   Configuring Resource-Based Kerberos Delegation to impersonate an administrator on the relayed machine.

Attack
------

In this scenario, we will demonstrate the second attack vector—leveraging Unconstrained Delegation to capture a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This assumes an attacker has administrative control over a server configured for Unconstrained Delegation, and Coercer is being executed from a Kali machine.

### Identifying Targets

We begin by identifying systems configured for Unconstrained Delegation using PowerView’s `Get-NetComputer -Unconstrained` command.

**Expected Output:**

WS001 and SERVER01 are configured for Unconstrained Delegation, making them prime targets. Since we have compromised WS001 and have administrative rights on the machine as 'Bob', we will proceed with the attack.

### Capturing TGTs

We start **Rubeus** in an administrative prompt on WS001 to monitor for new logons and extract TGTs.

Next, we determine the IP address of WS001 using `ipconfig`. With this information, we execute Coercer from our Kali machine, coercing DC1 to authenticate to WS001.

Switching back to WS001, Rubeus should now display a captured TGT for DC1.

With this TGT, we can authenticate as DC1, effectively becoming the Domain Controller. At this stage, a **DCSync attack** is a logical next step.

Prevention
----------

There is no built-in Windows functionality to monitor or block specific RPC calls, making these attacks difficult to mitigate. However, two key strategies can reduce exposure:

1.  Using an **RPC firewall** like Zero Networks' solution to block dangerous RPC functions. This firewall can operate in an audit mode to test its impact before full deployment.
2.  Blocking **outbound connections on ports 139 and 445** from Domain Controllers to limit coercing attacks. However, exceptions must be made for essential services, such as domain replication.

Detection
---------

Since Windows does not natively log RPC activity, an external firewall or logging solution is required to detect coercion attempts.

### Firewall Logs

A successful coercing attack using Coercer will generate firewall logs showing:

*   Inbound connections to the Domain Controller.
*   Outbound connections from the Domain Controller to the attacker machine on port 445.

_Insert your screenshot here._

When outbound traffic to port 445 is blocked, logs will instead show unsuccessful connection attempts.

_Insert your screenshot here._

Blocking both ports 139 and 445 is recommended to prevent fallback connections.

**Final Thoughts:** Monitoring unexpected dropped traffic to these ports can serve as a useful detection mechanism for coercion attempts.
