# Walkthrough: Introduction to the Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack, often referred to as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), is a powerful suite of tools for collecting, searching, and visualising log data. This walkthrough outlines the essential concepts and steps in the module, with placeholders for screenshots to be added later.

## 1. Understanding the Elastic Stack
The Elastic Stack consists of the following components:

- **Elasticsearch:** A distributed search and analytics engine.
- **Logstash:** A data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to a destination.
- **Kibana:** A visualisation tool for data stored in Elasticsearch.

## 2. Setting Up the Elastic Stack

### Installing Elasticsearch
- Download and install Elasticsearch from the official Elastic website.
- Configure the `elasticsearch.yml` file to customise settings (e.g., network binding, cluster name).

### Installing Logstash
- Install Logstash and set up a basic pipeline configuration file.
- Specify input (e.g., log files), filter (e.g., parsing and transformation), and output (e.g., Elasticsearch).

### Installing Kibana
- Install Kibana and configure the `kibana.yml` file to connect to your Elasticsearch instance.

## 3. Ingesting Data with Logstash
- Configure Logstash to read from a data source (e.g., system logs, CSV files).
- Apply filters to parse fields and normalise data.
- Output the data to Elasticsearch for indexing.

## 4. Visualising Data with Kibana

### Creating Index Patterns
- Navigate to the Kibana Management tab and create an index pattern to access data stored in Elasticsearch.

### Building Visualisations
- Use the Visualise feature to create custom charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- Examples include bar charts for log frequency or pie charts for source distribution.

### Exploring Dashboards
- Explore prebuilt dashboards or create your own by combining multiple visualisations.

## 5. Practical Use Cases

- **Security Monitoring:** Use Kibana to track anomalies and alerts in log data.
- **Performance Analysis:** Visualise application performance metrics.
- **Troubleshooting:** Pinpoint issues in logs quickly through interactive visualisations.

## 6. Hands-On Lab: Elastic Stack in Action

### Scenario
- Ingest a set of sample logs.
- Use Logstash to parse and enrich the data.
- Visualise the logs in Kibana to identify patterns.

## Conclusion
The Elastic Stack is a versatile toolset for managing and analysing large volumes of data. By mastering its components, you can gain actionable insights into system logs, monitor security events, and drive informed decision-making.
