**Tcpdump** is a command-line packet capture tool that can intercept and analyse network traffic directly from an interface or a saved file. Designed for Unix-like systems, it also had a Windows counterpart, WinDump, though support for it has ceased. Tcpdump is widely used due to its efficiency and flexibility, but it can seem daunting at first due to its numerous options and filters.

At its core, Tcpdump relies on **libpcap** to capture packets, allowing it to monitor network traffic passing through a system. By placing an interface into _promiscuous mode_, it can capture packets not just meant for the host but for other devices on the local network.

Installing and Locating Tcpdump
-------------------------------

To check if Tcpdump is installed on your system, run:

which tcpdump

It is usually found in `/usr/sbin/tcpdump`. If not installed, you can add it using:

sudo apt install tcpdump

Verify the installation with:

sudo tcpdump --version

Capturing Network Traffic
-------------------------

Tcpdump offers a variety of options to refine network capture. Below are some fundamental commands:

### Listing Available Interfaces

sudo tcpdump -D

### Selecting an Interface

sudo tcpdump -i eth0

### Disabling Hostname Resolution

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn

### Displaying Ethernet Headers

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e

### Viewing Packets in ASCII and Hex

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -X

### Combining Multiple Switches

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nnvXX

Understanding Tcpdump Output
----------------------------

Reading Tcpdump output can be overwhelming, but breaking it down into key elements helps:

*   **Timestamp**: The time the packet was captured.
*   **Protocol**: The protocol in use (e.g., IP, TCP).
*   **Source & Destination**: The packetâ€™s origin and destination, including port numbers.
*   **Flags**: TCP flags indicating packet behaviour.
*   **Sequence & Acknowledgement Numbers**: Used for tracking TCP segments.
*   **Protocol Options**: Additional negotiated parameters.

Saving and Reading Capture Files
--------------------------------

To save captured traffic to a file:

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ~/output.pcap

To read a saved capture:

sudo tcpdump -r ~/output.pcap
