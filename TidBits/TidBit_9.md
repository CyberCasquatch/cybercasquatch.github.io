# From weekly writing #9, this is TidBit 9

I have been trying the Hacker101.io website. It lets me know that I have no idea what I'm doing and I need to learn more about Burpsuite. 

Today I am completing the Investigating Windows Room on THM. 
 

I am following along with [Investigating Windows Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6bt835oZrA) this guy. 
Shoutout to this comment.
 
I was able to find the answer pretty quickly with regedit. 

I want to try other websites such as HackTheBox and PwnedLabs. 
I made a lot of python projects yesterday but many of them have bugs that I am still trying to fix.
