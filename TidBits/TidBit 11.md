# TidBit 11, created from weekly writing 11

I am trying out the Anonforce room on TryHackMe.
Utilising tryhackme [ANONFORCE walkthrough writeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viY-a3B1ItQ&t=1s)
I wasn't able to follow along after creating the .hash file, I seemed to be missing a step - so I searched for what step I was missing in the gpg syntax to correct myself. After a few stackoverflow comments and other searches I decided to look through another write-up to see if there was another way to go about completing the task. 
I found this video - 
[TryHackMeAnonforce WriteUp!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrC2nHxZ37g)

And found the syntax I was after, which was: gpg --import _insertfilenamehere_.pgp
after I followed this, I was able to complete the room. I enjoyed this one. I got to use John and GPG. 
I enjoy working in the terminals.
